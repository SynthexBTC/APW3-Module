# APW3 Module
This module allows you to control the voltage of an APW3 power supply <br>
from 12v to 14v, directly from an Antminer S19/S21 control board !

This module emulates the entire communication protocol <br>
to make it appear as if it were a genuine S19/S21 PSU.

- It uses a standard Antminer 4-pin voltage regulator cable.
- The module comes with a 60cm long 4-pin cable.
- A single button allows you to adjust the LED brightness and access the configuration menu.
- The RGB LED allows you to monitor activity and configuration.
- It has its own web server accessible via captive Wi-Fi for module configuration and *firmware updates*.
- Simulates many different APW PSUs.
- Controls the output voltage with high precision in 128 steps from 12V to 14V.
- Continuous monitoring of the output voltage is provided by a dedicated ADC input.
- 1500 Vrms Isolation between Control Board and PSU control.
