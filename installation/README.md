# Important Remarks

Use caution and stay electrically grounded when handling and install the module.

Two black wires need to be as short as possible to avoid EMI.<br>
So you shouldn't lengthen them.<br>
For greater immunity to noise, the two wires should also be twisted together.

# Wires Soldering

Remove the small blue potentiometer.

If you're skilled, you can remove it without dismantling the entire PCB :<br>
Using pliers, gently pull on it to break it and extract it.<br>
Be careful not to pull too hard so as not to break the copper traces !

Solder the two black wires.

One wire on the left hole and the other wire on the middle and/or right hole (as seen in the photo).

Very important : Make sure you have made good and clean solder joints.<br>
It is crucial that the cables do not become detached when the PSU is powered on !<br>
This could destroy the PSU.

# Wires Positioning

Position the cables in an L shape, as shown in the photo.<br>
They must be as close as possible to the ground plan.

You can then connect the power connectors.<br>
The red (positive) connector goes in front and the black (negative) connector goes in back.

To finish, put the cover back in place<br>
and tape the module to the front right side.
